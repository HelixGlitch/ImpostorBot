    ImpostorBot Patch Notes
=================================

v1.0.0 ImpostorBot: [October 11th, 2020]
 * The bot has officially become alive.
 * Added Sessions:
  - Use #begin to create a session in a voice channel
    // Sessions last until the moderator (owner, for programming purposes) leaves the channel one way or another.
    // When the moderator mutes/unmutes themselves, the bot server mutes/unmutes everyone in the voice channel respectively.
  - Use #transfer to transfer moderatorship (ownership, for programming purposes) to another user in the SAME voice channel.
  - Use #stop to stop all active sessions which you own.
  - Use #session to see the details of the session in your voice channel (if there is one) - moderator, channel, session id.
  - [ADMIN ONLY] Use #disable to pause the mute/unmute functionality of a session. Use the command again to enable it.
 
 * Miscellaneous additions:
  - Use #sus to eject someone (purely cosmetic).


v1.0.1 ImpostorBot: [October 12th, 2020]
 * Adjustments:
  - Fixed the feedback embed given by the #stop command: It is no longer the same as with #transfer.
  - Enabled the #stop feedback embed.
